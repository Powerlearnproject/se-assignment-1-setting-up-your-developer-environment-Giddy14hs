Setup Development Environment

#Assignment: Setting Up Your Developer Environment

#Objective:
This assignment aims to familiarize you with the tools and configurations necessary to set up an efficient developer environment for software engineering projects. Completing this assignment will give you the skills required to set up a robust and productive workspace conducive to coding, debugging, version control, and collaboration.

#Tasks:

1. Select Your Operating System (OS):
   Choose an operating system that best suits your preferences and project requirements. Download and Install Windows 11. https://www.microsoft.com/software-download/windows11

   Already had Windows 10 installed

2. Install a Text Editor or Integrated Development Environment (IDE):
   Select and install a text editor or IDE suitable for your programming languages and workflow. Download and Install Visual Studio Code. https://code.visualstudio.com/Download

   Already had visual studio code installed

3. Set Up Version Control System:
   Install Git and configure it on your local machine. Create a GitHub account for hosting your repositories. Initialize a Git repository for your project and make your first commit. https://github.com

   Aready had a Github account

4. Install Necessary Programming Languages and Runtimes:
  Instal Python from http://wwww.python.org programming language required for your project and install their respective compilers, interpreters, or runtimes. Ensure you have the necessary tools to build and execute your code.

   Installing Python on Windows
   Download Python Installer:
   Open the downloaded installer.
   On the first screen, make sure to check the box that says "Add Python to PATH". This ensures that you can run Python from the command line.
   Click on "Install Now" to begin the installation process.
   Complete the Installation:

   Wait for the installation process to complete.
   Once the installation is complete, you can verify the installation by opening a Command Prompt and typing "python --version" to see the installed python version

5. Install Package Managers:
   If applicable, install package managers like pip (Python).

6. Configure a Database (MySQL):
   Download and install MySQL database. https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/windows/installer/5.7.html

   Go to phoenixap.com/kb/install-mysql-ubuntu-20-04
   You are given the option to download either Web Community version or the full MySQL package
   After selecting a version, you are provided with the option of signing up for a community account or a direct download
   After accepting the license agreement, you can choose between several predefined options or create your custo setup type
   After choosing an option(Server only) and clicking next, youare ready to start the installation process. Click Execute to begin the process.
   Configure the server by clicking Next
   The first configuration option affects database availability. Choose the classic, single server option(Standalone My SQL Server)
   The second configuration section is used to define several essential features. In the Config Type option, create a development computer My SQL server then click next.
   Select the recomended "Use Strong Password Authentication" option and click next.
   You are now prompted to enter a password for your MySql root user. Input and click next.
   Define MySQL as a Windws Service so it can automatically start whenever the Windows system boots and click Next.
   You have successfully configured the MySQL server and need to confirm for the MySQL installer to appyly the configuration. An overview of the configuration steps appears on the screen . Click Execute to apply the configuration.
   Select Next to continue the installation process.
   Now you are given the ption to cpy the installation log to the clipboard. Click Finish to complete the My SQL server installation on Windows.
   Start MySQL server with the comand "--console" in the default installation folder



7. Set Up Development Environments and Virtualization (Optional):
   Consider using virtualization tools like Docker or virtual machines to isolate project dependencies and ensure consistent environments across different machines.

8. Explore Extensions and Plugins:
   Explore available extensions, plugins, and add-ons for your chosen text editor or IDE to enhance functionality, such as syntax highlighting, linting, code formatting, and version control integration.

   Extensions installed:
   Python extension
   Pylance
   Flake8 Linting
   Prettier
   Git integration


9. Document Your Setup:
    Create a comprehensive document outlining the steps you've taken to set up your developer environment. Include any configurations, customizations, or troubleshooting steps encountered during the process. 

#Deliverables:
- Document detailing the setup process with step-by-step instructions and screenshots where necessary.
- A GitHub repository containing a sample project initialized with Git and any necessary configuration files (e.g., .gitignore).

Github repository link: https://github.com/Giddy14hs/se-assignment-1-setting-up-your-developer-environment-Giddy14hs?tab=readme-ov-file

- A reflection on the challenges faced during setup and strategies employed to overcome them.

#Submission:
Submit your document and GitHub repository link through the designated platform or email to the instructor by the specified deadline.

#Evaluation Criteria:**
- Completeness and accuracy of setup documentation.
- Effectiveness of version control implementation.
- Appropriateness of tools selected for the project requirements.
- Clarity of reflection on challenges and solutions encountered.
- Adherence to submission guidelines and deadlines.

Note: Feel free to reach out for clarification or assistance with any aspect of the assignment.
